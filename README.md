# Updated Project Overview

This project is based on the paper **"Efficient Computation of Crossing Components and Shortcut Hulls"**. The algorithm simplifies complex polygon boundaries by inserting straight-line shortcuts between non-adjacent vertices—creating a **shortcut hull** that reduces complexity while preserving shape integrity.

- Efficient edge crossing detection
- Crossing component computation using pseudo-intersection graph
- Shortcut hull optimization with convex hull + dynamic programming
- λ-parameter-based cost function balancing area and perimeter
- Visualizations and benchmarking

## 🔍 How to Run

1. Download both `main.py` (from the `src` folder) and `test_polygon.py` (from the `tests` folder).
2. Place both files in the **same folder**.
3. Run the test file using:
   ```bash
   python test_polygon.py

---

## Generated Visualizations will be saved in the results/ folder.

## 🧪 Testing

We use a mix of:

- **Unit tests** for core components  
- **Integration tests** for overall flow  
- **Visual validations** via `matplotlib`  

**Test cases include:**

- Squares with diagonals  
- Star-shaped polygons  
- Large random polygons (up to 10,000 vertices)  

---

## 📈 Benchmarking & Performance

- **Runtime:** ~4 seconds for polygons with 10,000 vertices  

**Comparisons made against:**

- Naive edge crossing detection (**13x slower**)  
- Greedy shortcut selection (**our method is 18–30% better in cost**)  
- Douglas-Peucker (**faster** but less optimized on our cost function)  

---

## 🚀 Enhancements

- Colored crossing component visualization  
- λ-effect illustrations on hull shapes  
- Improved handling of floating-point edge cases  
- Optimized pocket detection logic
