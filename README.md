üõ†Ô∏è Updated Project Overview
This project implements an efficient algorithm for constructing shortcut hulls‚Äîsimplified, enclosing representations of a polygon formed using straight-line shortcuts between non-adjacent vertices. A key challenge lies in detecting and managing crossing shortcuts, which can invalidate the hull if not handled properly.

Building on the paper ‚ÄúEfficient Computation of Crossing Components and Shortcut Hulls‚Äù, we now understand that the process involves:

Efficient crossing detection using a sweep-line algorithm.

Compact representation of crossing components through a pseudo-intersection graph.

A tree-based clustering method to manage and organize overlapping shortcut sets.

Construction of the final shortcut hull using convex hull pockets, ensuring all vertices are enclosed while minimizing the number of shortcuts.

The implementation will make use of:

Sweep-line algorithm for pairwise intersection detection.

Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) for clustering crossing shortcuts into connected components.

Convex Hull algorithm (e.g., Graham scan or Andrew‚Äôs monotone chain) for constructing boundary pockets.

Tree traversal techniques for selecting valid shortcut subsets from each cluster.

These improvements reduce the time complexity from O(n^4) to O(n^3), enabling the algorithm to scale to larger polygonal inputs efficiently.
